# Pick's Theorem
According to Pick’s Theorem We can calculate the area of any polygon by just counting the number of Interior and Boundary lattice points of that polygon. If number of interior points are I and number of boundary lattice points are B then Area (A) of polygon will be:

Area  = I + B/2 - 1
