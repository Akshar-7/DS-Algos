### Titu's Lemma
**Titu's lemma** (also known as T2 Lemma, Engel's form, or Sedrakyan's inequality) states that for positive reals $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have

$$
\frac{a_1^2}{b_1} + \frac{a_2^2}{b_2} + \dots + \frac{a_n^2}{b_n} \ge \frac{(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)^2}{b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n}.
$$

### Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, states that for all sequences of real numbers $a_i$​ and $b_i$, we have 

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^2 \right) \ge \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i \right)^2
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a_i = k \cdot b_i$​ for a non-zero constant $k∈R$. It can be generalized to Hölder's inequality.

### Hölder's Inequality

Hölder's inequality is a statement about sequences that generalizes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to multiple sequences and different exponents.

Hölder's inequality states that, for sequences $a_i, b_i, \dots, z_i$, the inequality

$$
(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)^{\lambda_a} \dots (z_1 + z_2 + \dots + z_n)^{\lambda_z} \ge a_1^{\lambda_a} b_1^{\lambda_b} \dots z_1^{\lambda_z} + \dots + a_n^{\lambda_a} b_n^{\lambda_b} \dots z_n^{\lambda_z}
$$

holds for all $\lambda_a + \lambda_b + \dots + \lambda_z = 1$. For instance, in the case of $\lambda_a = \lambda_b = \frac{1}{2}$, Hölder's inequality reduces to

$$
(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)^{\frac{1}{2}} (b_1 + b_2 + \dots + b_n)^{\frac{1}{2}} \ge (a_1 b_1)^{\frac{1}{2}} + (a_2 b_2)^{\frac{1}{2}} + \dots + (a_n b_n)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

which is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
